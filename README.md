# MinesweeperCLI

The classic puzzle game, playable on a **Command Line Interface!**

## Special Note
As I have switched from Mac to Windows, I do not have JDK running yet. So, from this game onwards until I set up Java tools, this series will be developed in Python!

## Description

This is a low-tech version of the classic game minesweeper! Type commands into the terminal,
and sweep for mines! When you win, the mines are replaced with a beautiful garden! Rendering of the characters may fail depending on how old your computer is. Enter "quit" at any time to quit the program.
